# Vizuara-AIML
This is a project for ML engineer at Vizuara

Project of making an interactive MNIST Text classification teaching site using a given collab notebook

## Pages

Home - Basics

Machine Learning Basics - info - 1 page

Nn - basics - 1 page

CNN Basics - 1 page

Dataset

- MNIST (image, description and basic explanation) - 1 page
- Writing digit activity
- Preprocessing Reasoning  - 1 page
1. Blurring
2. RGB Color change

NN

- Loading MNIST data
- Training parameter choosing - 1 page 
            1.    hidden dimensions, epochs, train_test_split ratio, lr 
            2.    this page is for model training (kind of buttons referring to both the pages) 
- Model used - ClassifierModule from module_nn.py
- Result page 
            1.    Land to a result page explaining details of the model training
            2.    Should include accuracy and prediction and a couple of graphs explaining the model and what are the changes for different epochs
- Inference page (Want to explore more) - 
            1.    User can upload image and run a prediction or draw an image and predict the number choosing on NN 
            2.    Also this inference page should contain users to visualize the output 

https://ml4a.github.io/demos/confusion_mnist/ - reference for the confusion matrix

**CNN**

Loading dataset - MNIST

Parameter choosing - Kernel choosing, lr, epoch - model training

Model used - Cnn from model_cnn.py

Land to a result page explaining details of the model training

Inference page - User can upload image and run a prediction or draw an image and predict the number choosing on NN or CNN

Similar to the neural networks inference we can add another inference here.
